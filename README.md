## The-Uninnganeku
This is a two-week mini project for Collaborative Learning class at Kyushu University. The goal of the project is to illustration the process of decision making. It is supervised and reviewed by Professor Lauwereyns Johan from Cognitive Science Laboratory. 

The plots are developed separately by 5 members in our team. I was involved in all stages including planning, story-boarding, design, implementation and testing. Technicalities are handled by me alone. A detailed acknowledgement will be displayed in the end the game if you are able to maneuver your way to "happy endings" by making a series of right decisions. 

A [demo](https://the-uninnganeku.herokuapp.com/) for this is hosted on Heroku. 

Finally and most importantly, grateful thanks go to the creators of this fantastic [Monogatari framework](https://github.com/Monogatari/Monogatari). It is them who made everything alive and possible.
