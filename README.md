## The-Uninnganeku
This is a two-week mini project for Collaborative Learning class at Kyushu University. \
I was involved in all stages including planning, story-boarding, design, implementation and testing. \
The plots are developed separately by 5 members in our team. \
All technicalities are handled by me. A more detailed credits will be played in the end if you are able to pass the game by making right decisions. \

A [demo](https://the-uninnganeku.herokuapp.com/) is hosted on Heroku. \
Finally and most importantly, grateful thanks go to the creators of this fantastic [Monogatari framework](https://github.com/Monogatari/Monogatari). It is them who made everything alive and possible. \
